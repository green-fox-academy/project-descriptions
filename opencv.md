# Computer Vision ðŸ‘€ 

## Description

The purpose of this team is to help computers to understand the world as we see it. More preciesly we are going to process pictures and videos from car dashcams and tranport situations and try to make decisions based on that. These camera systems slowly but surely are getting a huge part in todays automobile industry (because only one camera can replace numerous sensors), this is why we are focusing only on trasporting. For that we are going to use OpenCV to process the camera input with C++.   

## Technologies

In this project we are using C++ to work with the OpenCV library. First the apprentices learn the basics of image processing and basic sorting algorithms. Later they start object detection (like circles and simple shapes). As they move on they will use Tesseract (OCR) for text recognition. With this the goal is to detect and read speed limit sings.

## Milestones

Since there are typically more teams working, there is two different ways after week 4.

 -  Week 1: project setup
 -  Week 2 and 3: basic image processing
 -  Week 4: advanced image processing
 -  Week 5 and 6:
   -  detecting and reading the speed limit from signs and controlling an rc car using that
   -  object classification and detection
